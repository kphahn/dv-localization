Object Segmentation
Ground Removal
Euclidean Clustering
Voxel filter - Method of downsampling point clouds


Cone Detection
    1. pre-processing
        Field of View trimming
        data correction (possible distortion)
        ground removal

    2. Cone Detection
        Clustering
        Reconstruction
        Cone legality verification

    3. (Colour Estimation)
        intensity analysis
        camera vision analysis
        

Challenges:
    choosing a reasonable epsilon for the dbscan method proves difficult, as the distance to noise is unknown.
    There is, however, an expected number of points per cone - depending on distance an lidar setup
